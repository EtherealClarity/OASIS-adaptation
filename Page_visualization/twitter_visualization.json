            "帖子内容": "Helen is a talented writer who has been comfortably living by writing popular western novels. Recently, she had the idea to write a novel that could have a significant impact on the literary world. If she succeeds in completing and gaining recognition for this novel, it could greatly boost her career. However, if her idea fails or the novel turns out to be a flop, she will have wasted a lot of time and effort with no reward. Helen will only attempt to write this novel if she believes the probability of success is high enough. Question: What do you think is the minimum probability of success that would make Helen decide to write this novel? What do you think? Should Helen be cautious and only go for it if the odds are really in her favor? Or should she embrace the creative challenge and take the leap?
